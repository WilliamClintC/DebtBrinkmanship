## Introduction {#sec-intro}

Constantly increasing public debt has been a recent occurrence throughout recent history @mitchener2023.
This raises the question of how will governments deal with rising debt burdens going forward.
As debt increases, cost of borrowing increases.
Do governments internalize the increase of cost of borrowing, in the context of debt ceiling brinkmanship?
We construct a data set of X-dates, dates where the US government will supposedly run out of money.
We then analyze the CDS prices and yield spreads, such that we investigate weather debt ceiling negotiations will settle earlier given a bigger increased in cost of capital.We investigate trends overtime.

It has also been noted we have debt crisis without default has become more common, wherein there was a near missed payment but never a default has a negative effect on output, as exemplified in Greece Portugal and Spain during 2010-2012 @mitchener2023 .
Going a step further some have propose to change the definition of debt crises to yield spreads of 1000 basis points, also known as spread spikes.
[@broner2013; @aguiar; @krishnamurthy].
We investigate if debt ceiling brinkmanship falls under this category.
There has been work on the frequency of debt crisis without default.
we study this data set by cite @meyer2022 as it relates data on debt ceiling brinkmanship @reinhart2008 we use the defintion of 1000 basis points we analyze these in the context of debt brinkmanship taking inspiration from graphs.

What makes this even more poignant is that the output decline happens in anticipation of a default rather than the default itself @yeyati2011 .
Thus we investigate if this link applies to debt ceiling brinkmanship as well.

What makes this an important topic to study is the body of evidence proving a decline in output associated with the high yields that accompanies a debt crisis.
There are varying reasons for this such as the relationship between external financing and importers @mendoza2012 , the decrease in external domestic firm borrowing[@corsetti2012; @das2010; @gourinchas2016] or the tightening of credit against loses on bank balance sheets[@arellano; @ferrando2017].Similarly, we explore this in the context of debt brinkmanship.

There has also been work on how credit rating agencies downgrading reduces leverage and investments @almeida2017.
Similar conclusions were drawn using CDS premia instead of bond yield spreads [@brutti2015; @bahaj2020].
Similarly, we explore this in the context of debt brinkmanship.

Another pertinent question is the many creditors willing to lend to highly indebted sovereigns.
Currently we are in a safe asset shortage, such that we are coming closer to the effective lower bound, wherein central banks could not decrease interest rates any further as needed.
This shortage is a key source of fragility in the economy, dubbed the "safety trap".
@caballero2017We investigate if brinkmanship is a contributor to the shortage of safe assets.
If so then there would be an argument to abolish the system on a global welfare standpoint.
Taking inspiration from

Track Chinese investments.

Track advance vs developed economies effects

currency composition\-- world currency composition.

We use the 1 year expected risk premium vs the 1 year treasury yield to construct a similar graph that marks debt ceiling brinkmanship.
Furthermore we construct the graph below with the same variables @duarte2015.

![](style-guide/1_year_ERP_parallel_trends.jpeg)

given the outsize buying of central banks we look at

. By answering this question we gain insight into the future of larger and larger public debt burdens going forward.

We investigate if its ias a threat to safe asset shortage.

The US treasury yield occupies the status as the biggest and most liquid market, wherein its yield is a signicant determinant of the global factor of yields.

Given that the global factor has become increasingly a more important determinant of yields ,against the specific "country" factor @mauro2002. thus it becomes important to study this phenomenon.[@rozada2006; @gonz√°lez-rozada2008; @longstaff2011]
